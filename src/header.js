            <p>  "A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You" is a 1925 song written by Joseph Meyer, with lyrics by Al Dubin and Billy Rose. The title was inspired by the famous line "A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread--and Thou" from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.[1][2] The song first gained popularity after it was performed (and recorded) by Gertrude Lawrence and Jack Buchanan in Andr√© Charlot's show Charlot's Revue[1] when it came to New York in 1926. The song was Dubin's first significant success[2] and was credited with bringing Lawrence and Buchanan popularity in the United States</p>
